Startups are designed with the goal of developing a business model repeatable and scalable, but entrepreneurs should keep in mind that the initial phase of a startup is marked by a scenario of extreme uncertainty. The consensus is that we are experiencing a revival of global entrepreneurship, but the lack of a management paradigm that allows rapid validation feedback of user demands makes opportunities and innovation initiatives run high risks. What makes it especially painful failure is not only the economic damage caused to employees, companies and investors, they are also a gigantic waste of the most precious resources of our civilization: the time, passion and people skills. The Lean Startup movement is dedicated to prevent failure frustrates new entrepreneurs, for such minimum viable product (MVP) is presented as tool to aid in the rapid validation of market assumptions. This paper proposes addition of a study on the profile of 100 startups from Goi\^ania focused on the use of the MVP, a plugin for developers working with Ruby on Rails allowing the construction of MVP's more quickly from an environment preconfigured with the focus continuous delivery.
